		<h2>Design Choices</h2>
		  <div class="accordion">
			<div class="accordion-item">
			  <a>Colors within the website</a>
			  <div class="content">
				<p>On the website we have decided to flip the colors. At first the background of the website was red and the navigation bar and footer nude. We changed it now to a pink background and red navigation bar and footer, we did this to bring more calmness to the page and when we would make use of a button we can use the color red this makes it more pop on the page. </p>
			  </div>
			</div>
			<div class="accordion-item">
			  <a>Polaroid Pictures</a>
			  <div class="content">
				<p>On the about us page we put pictures of the team members in the shape of a polaroid picture, this is a camera that is used a lot within our target audience. The polaroid pictures fit great within the uniqueness of XOXO because it is all about self-love and motivational quotes and quotes are also posted a lot in the shape of polaroid’s on social media. </p>
			  </div>
			</div>
			<div class="accordion-item">
			  <a>Services</a>
			  <div class="content">
				<p>During the user tests we got the result that it was not clear enough that the service was paid and what the services were. That is why we have created a page called ‘services’ on this page are the subscriptions described but also the services. When you have your mouse on the word service in the navigation bar a drop down menu will be visible with all the services. We also put a new button on the home page namely the free trail button in the color red together with more information about the services.</p>
			  </div>
			</div>
			<div class="accordion-item">
			  <a>Font Choice</a>
			  <div class="content">
				<p>In the brand road map we made use of the font ‘Bebas Nue’and 'Courier New', these fonts are not available on Google Fonts. Therefore, we chose a very similar font 'Courier Prime'. The font that we have chosen still provides the written feeling as the old font had within our brand road map.</p>
			  </div>
			</div>
			<div class="accordion-item">
			  <a>Amount of Text</a>
			  <div class="content">
				<p>During the user testing we got the feedback that we had too much text on our pages, that is why we have decided to change the design of the mission- , quotes- , and forum page. All the pages are mostly now image based, for example the mission page has their values in pictures, and the forum has the categories mostly displayed in logos. Last but not least we have decided to leave the welcome text on the quote page out, the quote page is now only pictures of quotes.</p>
			  </div>
			</div>
			 <div class="accordion-item">
			  <a>Login Button</a>
			  <div class="content">
				<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Elementum sagittis vitae et leo duis ut. Ut tortor pretium viverra suspendisse potenti.For our service it is important that the user has an account that is why we have chosen to put the login button on every page in the corner to give the viewer on every page the possibility to login. At first we had it only on the community/forum page.</p>
			  </div>
			</div>
			 <div class="accordion-item">
			  <a>Name Change</a>
			  <div class="content">
				<p>Last but not least we have decided to change the name of community into forum because a community can be everything and our brand specifically focusses on a forum.</p>

                    <h3>Effective</h3>
                    <p>The user is able to do what they want to do. For example within the website we offer different way to go to pages such as for the quote page. For the quote page the user can find it in the navigation bar, footer, and also on the homepage as a clickable carousel, this gives the viewer a choice of how their prefer to navigate to the website.
					<br>
					What the website also makes effective is that the viewer can personalize their interest within the forum. The viewer can choose a category which is interesting for them or even open a topic their selves. This makes it effective because the viewer can get answers to their specific questions.

                    <p>When the viewer comes on the website the viewer can directly see the services XOXO offers, with the use of the different buttons the user can for example start a free 30 day trail, or chat with employees this makes it easy to achieve their goal of subscribing or finding help. 
					<br>
					The user is able to find their the page they are looking for by the different choices to navigate to the webpage, this makes it easy and fast to find what they are looking for.

                    <p>During the user testing we got the compliment that the website was looking unique because of the combinations of colors. Also there is a consistency between the pages, this makes it for the viewer satisfying to watch.</p>

                    <h3>Error Tolerant</h3>
                    <p>During the user testing we had a situation of a participant choosing the wrong page within one of the assignment. When the participant saw that this was not the right page, the participant choose a page again. There were no hints given, so there was room for the participant to correct their mistake. </p>

                    <h3>Easy To Learn</h3>
                    <p>The participants were quickly to learn how everything worked. With the design of the prototype we made sure that we used things that were easy to understand or common for most of the people within our target audience. For example with the chat box it is an unique service that XOXO offers you can get there with the help of a button, this was new but once the viewer knows that the button of the chat box is always on the same place the user will find it quickly.</p>

This will be tested by a few assignment the participant has to complete, with those assignment she has to find her way through the website. The test will be done via a Teams call, or a real time appointment. </p>

					<h4>Number of participants and conditions:</h4>
					<p>During the testing process we had three participants who did the user testing. 
						<br>
						Conditions:
						The participant has to be within the target audience. Our target audience are girls located in the Netherlands from 16 until 26 years old who cope with insecurities and social pressure. 
						This was completed because all the participants were located within the target group, the participants were 19, 21, and 25 years old. 
						The participant should also be able to understand English because the website will be in English.</p>

	<h1>Reflection of the user testing report</h1> <!-- header message service card -->
    <p>After the first user testing the group started to reflect on the feedback that was given by the participant, this feedback was very briefly. We came to the conclusion that the assignment provided during the user testing were not enough and also too briefly and easy, they needed to be more specific and difficult. That is why we have changed the user testing questions for the second and third user tests. 
	The new questions are:
		1.	Log in
		2.	Find the chat box
		3.	Find the forum and choose a category
		4.	Go back to home page
		5.	Find the quote page via three ways
		6.	Find information about our team
		7.	Find our brand values
		8.	Subscribe to the services via two ways
		9.	Read about people’s experience with our services
		10.	Send us an e-mail
		11.	Go to our Instagram page
		<br>
		The results of the new assignments were more specific and we challenged the tester by providing them with more assignments who are specific and difficult. 
		<br>
		After the first user testing we came to the conclusion that we needed to focus more on the goal of the website namely selling the subscription from our service. We came to this conclusion because the first user was not aware that the services were paid because on the first version of the prototype specifically on the homepage the word free was mentioned. That is why we have changed the home page by creating a second prototype.</p>

	<h1>Conclusion of the user testing report</h1> <!-- header message service card -->
    <p>During the different user tests we got the opportunity to test our prototype and add things that we forgot or improve. For example we were not aware that we had too much text on our pages that is why we have changed the mission page, quotes, and forum page to an almost image only pages. Keep changing our user test assignments was also a good thing this improved the level of detail within the feedback we received. 
		<br>
		<br>
	With the user testing we also found out that we have to focus more on the goal of our website namely viewers buying a subscription that is why we have changed the set up after the first user testing by creating a new prototype. What we have created with the new prototype was still not good enough, that is why we added more things to our website such as a service page were all the prices and services are explained.
